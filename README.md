## Bloccit: a Reddit replica to teach the fundamentals

I built Bloccit as my first Rails app at Bloc in the Backend phase of my course.

## Bloccit's features include the ability to:

* create a user account with a username, email, and password, and use a Gravatar for a profile picture
* create topics, posts, and comments
* favorite posts and track new comments on them
* comment on a post and have it update immeadiately without needing to refresh
* edit and delete topics and posts if you created them or are an admin
* delete comments if you created them or are an admin
